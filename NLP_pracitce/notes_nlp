Classification Matrix

Accuracy - No of correct predicitions made by the model divided by the total number
eg - 80 correct out of 100 gives an  accuracy of 80/100 = 0.8
TP + TN / Total No
Error Rate -  FP + FN / Total

Recall - No of true positive / no of true positive + no of false negatives

Precision -> True Pos / true pos + false pos

F1 - Score -> 2 * precision * recall
                  ------------------
                  precision + recall
